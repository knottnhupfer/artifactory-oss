    </div>
    <div class="modal-body">
        <p>The remote repository at the URL you specified is hosted by another instance of Artifactory. This exposes additional capabilities you may configure:</p>
        <div class="sync-checkbox"
             ng-if="isSmartRepoSupportFeature('SYNC_STATISTICS')">
            <jf-checkbox text="Report Statistics">
                <input type="checkbox"
                       ng-model="smartRepo.statistics.enabled">
            </jf-checkbox>
            <p>
                If set, download statistics for the artifact at the remote Artifactory instance will be updated each time a cached item is downloaded from your repository.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sync-checkbox"
             ng-if="isSmartRepoSupportFeature('SYNC_PROPERTIES')">
            <jf-checkbox text="Sync Properties">
                <input type="checkbox"
                       ng-model="smartRepo.properties.enabled">
            </jf-checkbox>
            <p>
                If set, properties for artifacts that have been cached in this repository will be updated if they are modified in the artifact hosted at the remote Artifactory instance.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="sync-checkbox"
             ng-if="isSmartRepoSupportFeature('LIST_CONTENT')">
            <jf-checkbox text="List Remote Folder Items">
                <input type="checkbox"
                       ng-model="smartRepo.typeSpecific.listRemoteFolderItems">
            </jf-checkbox>
            <p>
                If set, Artifactory lets you navigate the contents of the repository at the remote Artifactory instance for all package types, even if the artifacts have not been cached in this repository.
            </p>
        </div>

                <input type="checkbox"
                       ng-model="smartRepo.source.originAbsenceDetection">
            </jf-checkbox>
            <p>
                If set, you will see an indication if a cached artifact has been deleted from the repository at the remote Artifactory instance.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>These settings are also available in the Edit Repository screen.</p>
